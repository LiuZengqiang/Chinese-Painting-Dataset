# Chinese-Painting-Dataset
Dataset for our CS231N project "Chinese Painting Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks".

For details of the project, see our poster at http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/posters/311.pdf and our report at http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/311.pdf. A lot of thanks to Guanyang Wang(王冠扬) and Ying Chen(陈颖) for their contribution to this project.

This dataset contains 5799 samples of Chinese painting each of which has 256x256 pixels. They are obtained by searching for specific key words in Google and Baidu, cropping, and removing duplicates. 

This dataset is for personal and academic use only.
